# Image Steganography
A little project I did that can hide messages in images
It's not very good, but neither am I at cryptography or steganography or any of these things.
I hope that I can be someday.

# Encrypting
This program takes an image, the text that you want to be hidden, and your password.
Then it hides your message in the image after encrypting it with your password.
This will stop any random idiot from reading your secret message but won't stop anybody who knows what they're doing.

# Decrypting
You can then decrypt the message that you've hidden inside the image.
You just enter the file name, password, and you recieve the hidden message.
The program also saves the message to a "message.txt" file in case you want to do more things with the message.
